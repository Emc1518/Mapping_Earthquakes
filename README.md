# Mapping Earthquakes

The purpose of this analysis is to use Leaflet to create a map that plots earthquakes around the globe using data from a government website. The points on the map indicate where there has been an earthquake in last 5 days. The size and colour of the points on the map change depending on the magnitude of the earthquake. The modifications to parts of the map are achieved by using d3 libraries.
